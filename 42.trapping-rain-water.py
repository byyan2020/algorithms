# Testcase Example:  '[0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]'
#
# Given n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width
# of each bar is 1, compute how much water it can trap after raining.
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: height = [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]
# Output: 6
# Explanation: The above elevation map (black section) is represented by array
# [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]. In this case, 6 units of rain water (blue section)
# are being trapped.
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: height = [4,2,0,3,2,5]
# Output: 9
# 
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# n == height.length
# 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^4
# 0 <= height[i] <= 10^5
# 
# 
#

        res = 0
        max_l, max_r = height[l], height[r]
        while l < r:
            if max_l < max_r:
                l += 1
                max_l = max(max_l, height[l])
                res += max_l - height[l]
            else:
                r -= 1
                max_r = max(max_r, height[r])
                res += max_r - height[r]
